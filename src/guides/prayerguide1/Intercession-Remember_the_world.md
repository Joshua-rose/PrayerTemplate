# Intercession - Remember the World

What or who do you want me to pray for.  Prayer for the kingdom.

Holy Spirit, what do you want me to pray for. What does God want me to interceed for.

<details><summary>1 Timothy 2:1-4 TPT </summary>Most of all, I'm writing to encourage you to pray with gratitude to God. Pray for all men with all forms of prayers and requests as you intercede with intense passion. [2] And pray for every political leader and representative, so that we would be able to live tranquil, undisturbed lives, as we worship the awe-inspiring God with pure hearts. [3] It is pleasing to our Savior-God to pray for them. [4] He longs for everyone to embrace his life and return to the full knowledge of the truth. </details>
<details><summary>1 Timothy 2:1-4 NIV </summary>I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people--- [2] for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. [3] This is good, and pleases God our Savior, [4] who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. </details>
